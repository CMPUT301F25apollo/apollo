# Apollo Event Lottery

**Apollo Event Lottery** is an Android application designed to provide a **fair and transparent event registration system** using a lottery-based waiting list. The platform helps organizers manage high-demand events while ensuring equal opportunity for participants.

---

## Overview

Traditional first-come-first-served event registrations can disadvantage users due to network latency or timing constraints. Apollo addresses this problem by introducing a **lottery-based enrollment system**, where participants are randomly selected from a waiting list once registration closes.

This project was developed as part of a collaborative software engineering effort, emphasizing clean architecture, scalability, and real-world usability.
